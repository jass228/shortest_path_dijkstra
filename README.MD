# Dijkstra's Algorithm

## Goal

Python implementation of the **_dijkstra algorithm_** which aims at finding the shortest path between two points of a graph.  
I used the following [course](https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/1608/shortest-paths-with-dijkstras-algorithm/dijkstras-algorithm) from [CodingGame](https://www.codingame.com/start) to implement this algorithm.

## Setup

```bash
> git clone https://github.com/jass228/shortest_path_dijkstras.git
> cd shortest_path_dijkstras
```

You'll find 3 python scripts:

- **_dijkstra.py_** : Script that I used to implement dijkstra algorithm
- **_graph.py_** : Script to build the graph by adding the missing nodes and edges. It is not necessary to use it if you give the graph as a dictionary with all nodes, weights and edges.
- **_app.py_** : Script to test my implementation of the algorithm
